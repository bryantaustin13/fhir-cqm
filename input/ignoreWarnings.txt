INFORMATION: CodeSystem/intended-venue-codes: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# 1.0.0-ballot:002 - The MultiRateExample is a composite measure and thus does not contain a population
WARNING: Measure/MultiRateExample-FHIR: Measure.group[5]: Measure Groups should have at least one population
